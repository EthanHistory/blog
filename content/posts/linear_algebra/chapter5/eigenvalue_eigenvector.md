If $A$ is an $n × n$ matrix, 
then a nonzero vector $x$ in $R^n$ is called an eigenvector of $A$ (or of the matrix operator $T_A$ ) 
if $Ax$ is a scalar multiple of $x$; that is,

$$
Ax = λx
$$

for some scalar $\lambda$. The scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue of $A$ (or of $T_A$ ), and $x$ is said to be an eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda$.
