If $\lambda_0$ is an eigenvalue of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$, then the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda_0$ is called the geometric multiplicity of $\lambda_0$, and the number of times that $(\lambda - \lambda_0)$ appears as a factor in the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is called the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda_0$.
