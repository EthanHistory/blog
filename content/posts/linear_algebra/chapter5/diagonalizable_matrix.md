If a square matrix $A$ is similar to some diagonal matrix, $A$ is said to be **diagonalizable**; that is, if there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}AP$ is diagonal. In this case the matrix $P$ is said to **diagonalize** $A$. Note that $P$ consists of eigenvectors of $A$ as column vectors and the diagonal matrix $P^{-1}AP$ has successive diagonal entries which are the eigenvalues that correspond to the successive columns of $P$.
