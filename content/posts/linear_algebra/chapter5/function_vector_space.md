A function with a continuous derivative is said to be continuously differentiable. There is a theorem in calculus which states that the sum of two continuously differentiable functions is continuously differentiable and that a constant times a continuously differentiable function is continuously differentiable. Thus, the functions that are continuously differentiable on (−  ,  ) form a subspace of F(−  ,  ). We will denote this subspace by C 1 (−  ,  ), where the superscript emphasizes that the ﬁrst derivatives are continuous. To take this a step further, the set of functions with m continuous derivatives on (−  ,  ) is a subspace of F(−  ,  ) as is the set of functions with derivatives of all orders on (−  ,  ). We will denote these subspaces by C m (−  ,  ) and C  (−  ,  ), respectively.
