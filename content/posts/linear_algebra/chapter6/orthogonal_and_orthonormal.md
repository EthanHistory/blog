# Orthogonality on exactly two vectors
Two vectors $u$ and $v$ in an inner product space $V$ called **orthogonal** if $<u, v> = 0$.

# Orthogonality on a set of two or more vectors
A set of two or more vectors in a real inner product space is said to be **orthogonal** if all pairs of distinct vectors in the set are orthogonal. An orthogonal set in which each vector has norm 1 is said to be **orthonormal**.
