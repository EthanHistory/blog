An inner product on a real vector space $V$ is a function that associates a real number $<u, v>$ with each pair of vectors in $V$ in such a way that the following axioms are satisfied for all vectors $u, v$, and $w$ in $V$ and all scalars $k$.

1. $<u, v> = <v, u>$ (Symeetry axiom)
2. $<u+v, w> = <u, w> + <v, w>$ (Additivity axiom)
3. $<ku, v> = k<u, v>$ (Homogenity axiom)
4. $<v, v> \ge 0$ with equality if and only if $v=0$ (Positivity axiom)

A real vector space with an inner product is called a **real inner product space**.

## properties
1. $<0, v> = <v, 0> = 0$
2. $<u, v+w> = <u, v> + <u, w>$
3. $<u, v-w> = <u, v> - <u, w>$
4. $<u-v, w> = <u, w> - <v, w>$
5. $k<u, v> = <u, kv>$
