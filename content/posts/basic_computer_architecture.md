As a basic computer architecture widely used, Von Neumann's computer architecture composes of CPU (central processing unit), Memory, I/O devices. These are fundamental abstractions on how the computer works. As you can see in the below diagram, CPU patch instructions from main memory and execute the instructions with some data from input devices, it's registers and main memory. The result of computation would be pass through output devices.
