# Intro
When we explain a ML project, most of people describe they are making a ML system, which means we don't make a small ML algorithm for a ML project anymore. As the matter of fact, the ML algorithm itself now becomes a tiny little part of a whole ML system, even thought the ML algorithm may be complicate or start-of-the-art. Even someone says "ML algorithm", now it end up with explaining the pipeline at least from data preprocessing to model evaluation. And the familiar concepts that we continuely have heard about is the processes before we get into the ML algorithm: Data preparation, Data preprocessing, Data cleaning, Data sourcing, Data validation, etc.
All these complexes give you a headache. Hopefully, for small projects, some of them don't need for small projects or are not that important than others. However, regardless of you size of ML projects, Data preprocessing and Data cleaning need to be explained since you are going to use data for training anyway.
