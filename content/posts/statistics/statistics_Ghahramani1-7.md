### randomly selected from an interval
A point is said to be randomly selected from an interval (a, b) if any two subintervals of (a, b) that have the same length are equally likely to include the point. The probability associated with the event that the subinterval $(\alpha, \beta)$ contains the point is defined to be $(\beta-\alpha)/(b-a)$
