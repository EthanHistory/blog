If the outcome of an experiment is **not certain** but all of its **possible outcomes are predictable** in advance, then the set of all these possible outcomes is called the **sample space** of the experiment and is usually denoted by $S$.

- The sample space of an experiment consists of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
- These outcomes called **sample points** or **points**.

- Certain subsets of $S$ are referred to as **events**

## Examples

Suppose that an experiment consists of two steps. First a coin is flipped. If the outcome is tails, a die is tossed. If the outcome is heads, the coin is flipped again. The sample space of this experiment $S = \\{T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6, HT, HH\\}$. For this experiment, the event of heads in the first flip of the coin is $E = \\{HT, HH\\}$, and the event of an odd outcome when the die is tossed dis $F = \\{T1, T3, T5\\}$.
