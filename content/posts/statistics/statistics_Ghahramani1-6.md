### Probabilities 0 and 1
Let's say $P(E) = 1$, and $P(F) = 0$   
It is not correct to say that E is the sample space S and F is
the empty set.
For example, in selecting real number from an sample space (0, 1),  
the probability of selecting any float number t is 0 
and the probability of selecting any other float numbers other than the number is 1.

Both event are not empty set nor sample space.
