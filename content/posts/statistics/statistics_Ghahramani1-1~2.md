- Definition
Mathmatical foundation of probability 
Sample space
Sample(Point)
Event

- Remark 
Different manifestations of outcomes of an experiment might lead to different
representations for the sample space of the same experiment.
-> you can represent sample space to be more comfort looking.

What does "event occurs" mean?
-> the outcome of an experiment belongs to an event E, event E has occurred.

- Concepts in sets applied to events
    - Subset
    - Equality
    - Intersection
    - Union
    - Complement
    - Difference
    - Certainty
    - Impossibility
    - Mutually Exculsiveness

    - Commutative laws
    - Associative laws
    - Distributive laws
    - De Morgan's first law
    $$
        (E \cup F)^c = E^cF^c \newline
        \biggl( \bigcup_{i=1}^n E_i \biggr)^c = \bigcap_{i=1}^n (E_i)^c
    $$
    - De Morgan's second law
    $$
        (EF)^c = E^c \cup F^c \newline
            \biggl( \bigcap_{i=1}^n E_i \biggr)^c = \bigcup_{i=1}^n (E_i)^c
    $$

**NOTE**

that Venn diagrams are an excellent way to give intuitive justification for the validity
of relations or to create counterexamples and show invalidity of relations. However, they are
not appropriate to prove relations.
