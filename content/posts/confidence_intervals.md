- a type of estimates for population parameter. (along with point estimate)

- a range of likely values for the population parameter based on 
1. the point estimate (e.g., the sample mean)
2. level of confidence
3. the sampling variability or the standard error of the point estimate.

the 95% Ci is the likely range of the true, unknown parameter.

the variance of sample is not the variance of sample mean 

how much samples 

Each row of points is a sample from the same normal distribution. The colored lines are 50% confidence intervals for the mean, Î¼. At the center of each interval is the sample mean, marked with a diamond. The blue intervals contain the population mean, and the red ones do not.
